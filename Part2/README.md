# Quantum counting

As you've probably learned from the other Microsoft Katas, Grover's algorithm is a way of accelerating unstructured search on quantum computers.  Importantly, one must know both the total size of the search space (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N"> ), and the total number of solutions to the search problem (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M"> ), to know the angle (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta"> ) that each Grover step rotates the state by:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sin^2{\theta/2} = M/2N">

This provides a stopping condition, becausing applying too many Grover steps will rotate the state past the point when the maximal success probability is achieved (i.e. when meausuring the output register will produce a bitstring that is included in the known solution set).  This discussion begs the question: what if you don't know the total number of solutions beforehand?  


One could always run Grover search for a range of different <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M">s, mesuring the output over each iteration and checking for those which are valid solutions, but we can do better.  The quantum couting algorithm (NC pg. 263) presents a solution, where one can use the quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPE) to estimate the eigenvalues of some unitary <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U"> , where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U">  is the Grover interation, which is

in the 2-d basis spanned by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|\alpha\rangle"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|\beta\rangle">, which are superpositions over all solutions and non-solutions to the search problem, respectively.  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G">  has eigenvalues <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^{i\theta}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^{i(2\pi-\theta)}">, which we then seek to estimate via quantum phase estimation.  Knowing <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N"> , we can compute <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M">  and thus know how many solutions exist to our search problem.  The circuit is

Importantly, in QPE we need to prepare an eigenstate of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U">  on the target register, in order to extact the eigenvalue of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|u\rangle"> into the phase of the control qubits.  Since don't know <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta"> yet, we cannot prepare an eigenstate, so we just prepare a uniform superposition, which is a superposition of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|a\rangle"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|b\rangle">, by which we denote the two eigenvectors of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U"> (these lie in the same plane as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|\alpha\rangle"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|\beta\rangle">, but define a rotated basis).  Thus, we extract either <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta"> or <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2\pi - \theta"> with some probability, which are both fine since we plug them into <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sin^2 \theta/2"> in the end.

In the displayed circuit diagram, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t"> refers to the number of qubits needed in QPE, and ultimately determines the resolution with which we can learn <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta">, and also the probability with which the circuit succeeds at all.  The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> register refers to the workspace of the Grover unitary, which just needs however many qubits are involved in the search algorithm.
